WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a web standard that enables passwordless authentication using public key cryptography. Let me explain the key aspects:

1. Core Concept:
- Instead of passwords, WebAuthn uses public-private key pairs for authentication
- The private key stays securely stored in the user's device (like a phone or security key)
- The public key is stored on the web server

2. Authentication Flow:
- When registering, the device creates a new key pair
- The private key never leaves the device
- During login, the server sends a challenge
- The device signs the challenge with the private key
- The server verifies the signature using the stored public key

3. Security Benefits:
- Eliminates password-related vulnerabilities (phishing, reuse, weak passwords)
- Resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks
- Can require biometric verification (fingerprint/face) for additional security
- Keys are bound to specific domains, preventing phishing

4. Common Methods:
- Platform authenticators (built into devices like fingerprint sensors)
- Roaming authenticators (USB security keys)
- Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition)


## Origin Validation

1. During Registration:
- The origin (protocol + domain + port) is included in the client data that gets signed
- The private key becomes cryptographically bound to this specific origin
- This binding is stored in the authenticator (device/security key)

2. During Authentication:
- The browser includes the current origin in the client data
- The authenticator verifies this matches the origin from registration
- If the origins don't match exactly, the authentication fails

For example:
- If you register on `https://example.com`
- An attacker's site `https://evil-example.com` cannot use that credential
- Even `http://example.com` (different protocol) would fail
- Even `https://sub.example.com` (subdomain) would fail

This origin validation:
- Makes phishing practically impossible
- Prevents credential replay attacks
- Ensures credentials can only be used on the legitimate site
- Is enforced by the browser and authenticator, not trust-based

This is a key advantage over passwords, where users might accidentally enter their credentials on a phishing site that looks legitimate.
