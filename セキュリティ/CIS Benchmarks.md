CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmarks are widely-recognized ==best practice standards for securing IT systems and data==. They provide detailed security configuration guidelines for various technologies including operating systems, cloud platforms, mobile devices, and network devices.

Key aspects of CIS Benchmarks include:

1. Prescriptive Guidance: Each benchmark contains specific, detailed recommendations for securing a particular technology, typically organized into different levels:
   - Level 1: Essential security configurations that minimize impact on business functionality
   - Level 2: More stringent security settings for environments requiring heightened security

2. Configuration Categories: Benchmarks typically cover:
   - Account and password policies
   - File system permissions
   - Network security settings
   - Audit and logging configurations
   - Service and application settings
   - System hardening requirements

3. Implementation Methods: The benchmarks can be implemented through:
   - Manual configuration following the documented guidelines
   - Automated tools and scripts
   - Security compliance software that checks against CIS standards
   - Cloud provider security tools that reference CIS benchmarks

4. Regular Updates: CIS maintains and updates these benchmarks through a community-driven process involving security experts, technology vendors, and practitioners.

The benchmarks are particularly valuable for:
- Organizations needing to establish baseline security configurations
- Compliance with various regulatory requirements (as many regulations reference CIS benchmarks)
- Security teams developing system hardening procedures
- Auditors evaluating system security postures
