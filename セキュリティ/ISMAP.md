## ISMAP: Information System Security Management and Assessment Program

### Definition and Purpose

ISMAP is a Japanese government certification program established in 2020 that provides a standardized **framework for assessing and verifying the security posture of cloud service providers (CSPs) seeking to participate in public sector projects**. The primary objective is to ensure appropriate security standards in government cloud services procurement by evaluating and registering cloud services that meet specific Japanese government security requirements.

### Governance Structure

ISMAP is jointly operated by multiple Japanese government entities:

- The National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC)
- The National Strategy Office of Information and Communications Technology
- The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC)
- The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)

Additionally, the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), an independent administrative agency, provides technical support for the program implementation.

### Technical Requirements and Assessment Process

The certification process involves a thorough assessment of security controls implemented by CSPs, focusing on:

1. **Documentation Submission**: The initial phase requires submission of comprehensive documentation that demonstrates the organization's information security management system (ISMS) and its operational controls.
    
2. **Security Requirements Validation**: CSPs must implement specific security controls across multiple domains including:
    
    - Identity and access management
    - Infrastructure security
    - Data protection mechanisms
    - Incident response capabilities
    - Business continuity planning
    - Compliance with relevant regulations
3. **Third-Party Assessment**: Certification requires an assessment conducted by ISMAP-approved independent third-party auditors who evaluate compliance with all security requirements.
    
4. **Onsite Audit**: The certification process includes an onsite audit by ISMAP-accredited auditors to verify implementation of the documented controls.
    

### Technical Benefits

The ISMAP certification provides significant benefits for both CSPs and government agencies:

1. For government agencies: It eliminates the need to perform individual due diligence assessments of CSPs, accelerating cloud service procurement processes.
    
2. For CSPs: Certification provides a streamlined path to government contracts without requiring separate security validations for each procurement.
    

### Maintenance Requirements

To maintain ISMAP certification, CSPs must undergo annual surveillance audits conducted by third-party organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with security requirements. These audits verify that security controls remain effective and that any changes to the environment continue to meet ISMAP standards.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing systems for ISMAP compliance, organizations should:

1. Conduct a thorough gap analysis against ISMAP requirements
2. Implement robust security controls aligned with Japanese federal government practices
3. Establish continuous monitoring mechanisms
4. Document all security procedures and controls
5. Prepare for rigorous third-party assessments

The ISMAP framework represents Japan's strategic approach to cloud security standardization for government procurement, ensuring consistent security baselines while streamlining the procurement process.
