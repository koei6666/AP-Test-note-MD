Ghidra is a powerful software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. It was publicly released as open-source software in 2019. Here are some key points about Ghidra:

1. Purpose: Ghidra is primarily used for analyzing compiled code to understand its functionality, often when source code is not available.

2. Features:
   - Disassembly and decompilation of various executable formats
   - Support for a wide range of processor architectures
   - Graphical user interface for code analysis
   - Extensible architecture allowing for custom scripts and plugins

3. Multi-platform: It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

4. Free and open-source: Available under the Apache License 2.0.

5. Uses: 
   - Malware analysis
   - Vulnerability research
   - Software security audits
   - Legacy code understanding

6. Programming language: Primarily written in Java, with some components in C++.

7. Community: Has a growing community of users and developers contributing to its improvement and creating extensions.

Ghidra is particularly notable for its powerful decompiler, which can convert machine code back into approximate C-like source code, making it easier for analysts to understand complex software systems.
