XVWA stands for Xtreme Vulnerable Web Application. It's a deliberately insecure web application designed for security professionals, developers, and students to practice identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities.

Some key points about XVWA:

1. It's an open-source project intended for educational purposes.

2. XVWA contains various types of vulnerabilities found in real-world web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references.

3. It's used as a training tool to help people understand how vulnerabilities work and how to fix them.

4. The application is not meant for production use, as it's intentionally vulnerable.

5. It can be useful for practicing penetration testing techniques in a safe, controlled environment.
