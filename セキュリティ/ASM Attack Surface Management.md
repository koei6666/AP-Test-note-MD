# Attack Surface Management (ASM)

Attack Surface Management (ASM) is a systematic approach to identifying, classifying, monitoring, and managing an organization's complete external-facing IT asset inventory and associated vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threat actors.

## Technical Definition

ASM encompasses the continuous discovery, inventory, classification, prioritization, and remediation of exposed assets and vulnerabilities across an organization's entire attack surface, including both known and unknown assets.

## Core Components

1. **Asset Discovery**: Continuous identification of internet-facing assets, including IPs, domains, cloud resources, and shadow IT.
    
2. **Attack Vector Analysis**: Evaluation of potential paths that attackers could use to compromise systems, including exposed services, misconfigurations, and vulnerable components.
    
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identification and prioritization of security weaknesses within the discovered attack surface.
    
4. **Risk Contextualization**: Correlation of vulnerabilities with business context, threat intelligence, and exploitation potential.
    
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time surveillance of changes to the attack surface and emerging vulnerabilities.
    

## Security Implications

ASM is critical for:

- Reducing the organization's exploitable footprint
- Identifying shadow IT and rogue assets
- Establishing security baseline visibility
- Supporting vulnerability management programs
- Prioritizing remediation efforts based on risk exposure

ASM differs from traditional vulnerability management by focusing on comprehensive external asset visibility rather than just known internal assets.
