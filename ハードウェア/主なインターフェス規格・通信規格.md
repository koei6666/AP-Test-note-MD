## 主なインターフェス規格・通信規格

1. #ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment): An interface used to ==connect storage devices like hard drives== to the computer. It's also known as IDE.

2. **ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface - ATA-4):** An extension of ATA that provides additional capabilities, allowing devices such as ==CD-ROM and DVD drives, tape drives, and large-capacity floppy drives to be connected.

3. **SCSI (Small Computer System Interface):** A set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. SCSI is most commonly used for hard disk drives and tape drives.

4. #iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface): An IP-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. It provides block-level access to storage devices over a TCP/IP network.

5. #IEEE1394 (FireWire): A high-speed interface standard for transferring digital data between computer and peripheral devices or between computers. It's similar to USB.
　 it supports Daisy chain connection and Tree connection

6. **PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect):** A hardware interface for connecting high-speed devices to a computer. Commonly used for graphics cards, network cards, and disk controllers.

7. **AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port):** A high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a graphics card to a computer's motherboard, primarily to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics.

8. **PCI Express (PCIe):** A high-speed hardware interface that has largely replaced AGP, PCI, and PCI-X. It provides more bandwidth and is compatible with existing operating systems.

9. $I^2C$ Bus (Inter-Integrated Circuit):A bus for interconnecting integrated circuits in a system, often used in control systems and for attaching low-speed peripherals.

10. **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface):** A proprietary audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device.

11. **DisplayPort:** A digital display interface primarily used to connect a video source to a display device (like a computer monitor), and it can also carry audio, USB, and other forms of data.

12. **IrDA (Infrared Data Association):** An old standard for wirelessly transferring data over short distances using infrared light.

13. **Bluetooth:** A wireless technology for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz.

14. **NFC (Near Field Communication):** A set of communication protocols for communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm (1​1⁄2 in) or less. NFC-enabled devices can act as electronic identity documents and keycards.

15. **PLC (Power Line Communication):** A communication protocol that uses electrical wiring to simultaneously carry both data, and Alternating Current (AC) electric power transmission or electric power distribution.

16. **Bus Power:** In terms of interfaces, it's often referred to the power supplied by the interface to the connected devices. USB, for example, can supply power to connected devices, which allows for things like USB charging.
