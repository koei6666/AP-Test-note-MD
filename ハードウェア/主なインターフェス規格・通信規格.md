### Energy harvesting
Energy harvesting, also known as power harvesting or energy scavenging, refers to the process of capturing and storing small amounts of energy from external sources. This energy is usually derived from ambient environmental sources. Here are key aspects of energy harvesting, accompanied by real-world examples: ^728c3a

1. **Sources of Energy:**
   - **Solar Energy:** Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity, which can be stored for later use. For instance, solar-powered calculators and outdoor lighting systems harness solar energy.
   - **Vibration Energy:** Piezoelectric materials can convert mechanical vibrations into electrical energy. This can be used in industrial settings where machinery vibrations are prevalent.
   - **Thermal Energy:** Thermoelectric generators convert temperature differences into electrical energy. For instance, wearable devices could harvest body heat to recharge their batteries.
   - **Radio Frequency (RF) Energy:** Antennas can capture RF energy from ambient radio waves. This can be seen in some RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) systems.
   - **Wind Energy:** Miniature wind turbines can capture wind energy to generate electricity, useful in remote or off-grid locations.

2. **Applications:**
   - **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs):** In industrial or environmental monitoring systems, energy harvesting can power sensors, reducing the need for battery replacements.
   - **Wearable Electronics:** Harvesting energy from body movement or heat can help power wearable devices like fitness trackers.
   - **Remote or Off-Grid Locations:** In areas where grid power is unavailable, energy harvesting can provide a crucial power source.
   - **Smart Buildings:** Energy harvesting can power sensors and controls for lighting, heating, and cooling systems, contributing to energy efficiency.

3. **Storage:**
   - Harvested energy is often stored in capacitors or rechargeable batteries for later use.
   - For instance, a solar-powered outdoor light might store harvested solar energy in a battery during the day to provide lighting at night.

4. **Technologies and Components:**
   - **Transducers:** Convert ambient energy into electrical energy. Examples include photovoltaic cells for solar energy, piezoelectric materials for vibration energy, and thermoelectric generators for thermal energy.
   - **Energy Storage Devices:** Such as rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors, store harvested energy.
   - **Energy Management Circuitry:** Regulates the harvesting, storage, and delivery of energy to ensure efficient operation.

5. **Challenges:**
   - The amount of energy that can be harvested is often limited, and may not be sufficient for continuous operation of power-hungry devices.
   - The cost and complexity of implementing energy harvesting systems can be a barrier, especially in applications where traditional power sources are readily available and cost-effective.

Energy harvesting presents a sustainable solution for powering low-energy devices, especially in environments where replacing batteries frequently is impractical or where other power sources are unavailable. By harnessing ambient energy, it contributes to energy conservation and enables the operation of autonomous, self-sustained electronic systems.
