NAND flash memory is designed to read and write data in page units due to its internal architecture and operation. Here are the main reasons why NAND memory operates on a page level:

1. Physical Organization: NAND flash memory is organized into blocks, which are further divided into pages. A page is the smallest unit that can be written or read at once. This structure is a result of the way NAND memory cells are arranged and connected.
2. Parallelism: Within a NAND flash chip, there are multiple arrays of memory cells that can be accessed in parallel. Reading or writing is done by accessing multiple cells simultaneously, which corresponds to a page size (typically 2KB to 16KB).
3. Error Correction: Each page in NAND memory includes extra storage space for error correction codes (ECCs). These ECCs are used to detect and correct bit errors that may occur during read or write operations. Operating on a page level allows for efficient error correction.
4. Erase Operation: NAND memory can only be erased on a block level, not a page level. However, before a page can be rewritten, it needs to be erased first. Writing happens on a page level to avoid erasing an entire block unnecessarily when only a small portion of data needs to be updated.
5. Wear Leveling: NAND memory cells have a limited number of write/erase cycles before they wear out. By writing data in page units, the wear can be distributed more evenly across the memory cells, extending the lifespan of the NAND flash.
6. Optimization: Reading and writing on a page level allows for optimizations in the NAND memory controller and interface. It simplifies the addressing, buffering, and data transfer mechanisms, leading to better performance and efficiency.
