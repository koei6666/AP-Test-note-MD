Let me explain the `/proc` filesystem in Linux.

`/proc` is a special pseudo-filesystem in Linux that provides a window into the running system. It's not a real filesystem on disk - rather, it's a virtual filesystem that exists in memory and provides an interface to kernel data structures. 

Here are the key aspects of `/proc`:

1. Process Information
- Each running process has a numbered directory (matching its PID)
- Inside each process directory you can find:
  - `cmdline`: The command that started the process
  - `status`: Process status, including memory usage
  - `fd/`: Open file descriptors
  - `maps`: Memory mappings
  - `environ`: Environment variables

2. System Information
- `/proc/cpuinfo`: CPU details
- `/proc/meminfo`: Memory usage statistics
- `/proc/version`: Kernel version
- `/proc/loadavg`: System load averages
- `/proc/uptime`: System uptime
- `/proc/sys/`: Configurable kernel parameters

3. Key characteristics:
- Files are usually read-only
- Most files are 0 bytes in size (data generated on read)
- Information is real-time and dynamic
- Very low overhead to access

Example usage:
```bash
# View CPU info
cat /proc/cpuinfo

# Check memory stats
cat /proc/meminfo

# See what command started process 1234
cat /proc/1234/cmdline
```
