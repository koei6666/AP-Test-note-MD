## Technical Implementation Concepts

### 1. Policy-Based NAT

Policy-based NAT allows you to define specific NAT policies that map different internal network segments to different external IP addresses based on defined criteria such as:

- Source network/subnet
- Destination address/service
- Application type
- User identity (in next-generation firewalls)

### 2. NAT Pool Configuration

This typically involves:

- Defining multiple external IP address pools
- Creating NAT policies that map specific internal subnets to specific external address pools
- Implementing routing rules to ensure return traffic is correctly handled

### 3. Common Use Cases

- Regulatory compliance requiring specific traffic to be sourced from dedicated IPs
- Segregating traffic for security monitoring
- Providing different service levels for different internal departments
- Maintaining separate public identities for different business units

### 4. Implementation Considerations

When implementing such a configuration, consider:

- Proper routing table configuration to ensure return packets are directed correctly
- Stateful firewall rule consistency across NAT translations
- Logging and monitoring for each NAT pool
- Proper documentation of the NAT policy mapping

This capability is available in enterprise firewalls like Cisco ASA/Firepower, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet FortiGate, Check Point, and pfSense, among others. The specific configuration syntax would depend on your firewall platform.
