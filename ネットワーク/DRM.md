DRM (Digital Rights Management) servers play a key role in protecting digital content from unauthorized access and distribution. Here's a concise explanation of how they typically work:

1. Content encryption: The original content (e.g., video, audio, software) is encrypted using a specific encryption algorithm.

2. License generation: When a user purchases or rents content, the DRM server generates a unique license containing decryption keys and usage rights.

3. Content distribution: The encrypted content is distributed to users, often via download or streaming.

4. License acquisition: When a user tries to access the content, their device contacts the DRM server to obtain the license.

5. Authentication: The DRM server verifies the user's identity and rights to access the content.

6. License delivery: If authentication is successful, the server sends the license to the user's device.

7. Content decryption: The user's device uses the decryption keys from the license to decrypt and play the content.

8. Enforcement: The DRM client on the user's device enforces the usage rights specified in the license (e.g., expiration date, number of plays).
