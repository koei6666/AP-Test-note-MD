#バランス木
 in the term of search in BST, when its a tree with equal height in both side, then it can operate search operation efficiently, however, if the tree is constructed with unbalanced height, then it will be inefficient.
 from root to its leaf, the tree constructed with about same height is called balanced tree.
 inside balanced tree, there is #AVL tree which is based on binary tree and B tree based on multi-way tree.
 both of these 2 kind of structures can auto balance and make adjustment if balance is affected by node insertion and deletion.

  >[!AVL tree]
  >An AVL tree (named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a type of binary search tree that automatically adjusts its balance to ensure that operations like insertion, deletion, and search can be performed efficiently. 
>Here are some key features of AVL trees:
>1. **Self-balancing**: The key feature of an AVL tree is that it is self-balancing. After every insertion or deletion operation, it checks the balance of the tree and performs rotations to ensure that the tree remains balanced. This guarantees that operations can be performed in logarithmic time.
>2. **Balance factor**: Each node in an AVL tree has a balance factor, which is the height of the node's left subtree minus the height of the node's right subtree. The balance factor of any node in an AVL tree is always -1, 0, or 1. If the balance factor of any node is not in this range after an insertion or deletion, the tree performs rotations to bring it back into this range.
>3. **Rotations**: AVL trees use four types of rotations to maintain balance: left-left rotation, right-right rotation, left-right rotation, and right-left rotation. The names of the rotations indicate the "heavy" side of the unbalanced subtree. For example, a left-left rotation is used when the left subtree of a node's left child is "heavy" (has too many nodes).
>4. **Logarithmic height**: Because AVL trees are always balanced, the height of an AVL tree with N nodes is always O(log N). This means that operations like search, insertion, and deletion can all be performed in O(log N) time.
>5. **Ordered**: Like all binary search trees, AVL trees maintain an ordering among their elements, such that for any node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node. This makes AVL trees suitable for operations that require ordered data, like finding the minimum, maximum, predecessor, or successor elements.
>6. In summary, AVL trees are a type of binary search tree that automatically maintain their balance, ensuring that operations can be performed efficiently. They are more complex to implement than basic binary search trees due to the need for maintaining balance, but they provide better guarantees for operation times, making them useful in applications where good performance is important.
